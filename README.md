# OS Project 2
No particular commands are required to run the program; simply run `Project2.java`. No command line arguments are required.

The project may be configured using the top level variables in `Project2`. In particular, output may be redirected
to an arbitrary location (such as a file) by setting `out`, and the program may be accelerated by setting `TIME_SCALE` 
to a value less than 1. The number of customers and workers may also be freely changed.
